# README Generator

This is a README.md generator to provide a professional framework to any project. The effcient use of a Command Line Interface (CLI) increases the efficiency for any user when generating a README file. The application uses Inquirer to prompt the user with specific questions to fill in the README framework, once the user has answered all the questions the application does all the work for them.
